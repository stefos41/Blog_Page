      <p class="second">
        Hi, I'm 17 years old going into my senior year of
        high school. I wanted to share a little about me.
        Some of my main interests include skiing, tennis,
        fishing, traveling, and gaining new knowlege on
        ideas like coding and investments. In the future
        some goals include getting experience within
        multiple different languages of code. For now I have
        hours in html, css, and python. I will continue to
        keep my eyes open for any new hobbies that seem of
        interest.

      <h2 class="first">Traveling</h2>
      <p class="second">
        Traveling has been a big part of my life since I was
        little. Being to many countries has given me a
        perspective on life that many arent able to have.
        For this reason I feel very blessed to have been
        able to travel. In fact, these photos below are some
        of the many places I've seen.

      <h2 class="first">Skiing</h2>
      <p class="second">
        One of my longest and favorites sports or hobbies
        that I do is skiing. Each year during the winter
        season I end up heading out for some big mountain
        skiing. Recently I've been heading out West, but
        I've been to Canada too.

        This is a photo from Jackson Hole; my top ski
        resort. You can see that this year was a crazy year
        for snowfall. Jackson hole had some crazy pour
        downs, amounting to 595 inches in the 2022-2023
        season.
